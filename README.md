# Watson snap packaging

This trivial snapcraft.yaml simply creates a snap package of
[Watson](https://tailordev.github.io/Watson/), a time tracker which can work
both locally or in conjunction with "crick" for remote sync/aggregation of time
tracking data.

## Problems?

Please file [snap-related issues
here](https://github.com/Roadmaster/watson-snap/issues). Note the snap is
unofficial and unrelated to the Watson project directly.
